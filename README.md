*Abstract:* Many experiments in computer graphics imply that the average quality of
quasi-Monte Carlo integro-approximation is improved as the minimal distance of the point
set grows. While the definition of (t,m,s)-nets in base b guarantees extensive
stratification properties, which are best for t=0, sampling points can still lie
arbitrarily close together. We remove this degree of freedom, report results of two
computer searches for (0,m,2)-nets in base 2 with maximized minimum distance, and
present an inferred construction for general m.  The findings are especially useful in
computer graphics and, unexpectedly, some (0,m,2)-nets with the best minimum distance
properties cannot be generated in the classical way using generator matrices.
